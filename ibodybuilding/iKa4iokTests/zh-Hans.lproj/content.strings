//Chest

"Bench Presses" = "仰卧推举";
"To properly perform a bench press exercise you need to lay flat on a bench and have your feet flat on the floor. The bar, when racked, will be slightly behind your head. It is important to use a spotter for this exercise, especially if you are using a free bar or dumbbells, to eliminate the chance of dropping the weight on yourself. Once you have lifted the weight off of the rack, the bar will be directly over the center of your chest. Keep your head on the bench at all times throughout the movement. Once you have the bar steady, slowly lower it to about chest level, if you are able to. Keep your arms pointed outward as the bar drops. Upon reaching the bottom of the movement, press the bar back up to an extended position, focusing on driving the bar upwards with your chest and arms." = "为了正当地进行仰卧推举这个锻炼，你必须平躺于训练椅上，将双脚平放于地板上。掛着的杠桿处于你头部的略后方。在此锻炼中，监视人的看管是至关重要的，这是为了排除负重落在你身上的可能性 ，尤其是当你使用不掛在架上的杠桿或哑铃。当你从架子举起负重时，该杠桿将位于你胸部的上方。在整个动作的过程，保持你的头部固定在训练椅上。当你确保杠桿处于稳定状态时，如果你有能力，缓慢地将其降低至胸部水平。在放下杠桿的期间，保持你的手臂向外。当杠桿位于低位时，将杠桿再次往上推举，直到你处于伸展姿态，专注于使用胸部和手臂将杠桿朝上推举。";

"Incline Presses" = "上斜卧推";
"This exercise is very similar to the regular barbell bench press except that you will be using an incline free weight bench press machine and your upper chest will be the muscle group worked instead of your middle chest. Lift the barbell off of the rack and slowly lower it to about 3 inches above your clavicle (just below your Adam's apple) and then press the bar back to the start position. DO NOT TOUCH THE BAR TO YOUR UPPER CHEST (this causes unneeded stress on your shoulder joints and takes the tension away from your upper pec muscles, which are what we want to be doing the work!). Be sure that when you are lowering the bar that you do so in a slow and controlled fashion. Conversely, when you press the bar upward, you want to do so in an explosive fashion." = "此锻炼与正规的杠铃卧推锻炼极其类似，在这个锻炼中，你使用上斜卧推自由重量训练器，锻炼的肌群是上胸部，而不是胸部中央。举起架上的杠桿，缓慢地降低它至锁骨以上约三英寸（喉结略下方），然后将杠桿推回初始位置。勿使杠桿触碰你的上胸部（这为肩关节带来不必要的应力，确保你的上胸肌不受张力影响，此避忌对我们的锻炼是极其重要的！）。当你降低杠桿时，确保你的动作缓慢，以及受控制。反之，你能激烈地往上推举杠桿。";

"Dumbbell Presses" = "哑铃卧推";
"Get into position by sitting on the bench, hold the dumbbells and allow them to rest on your thighs.

To get up, hold the dumbbells by your chest, kick your legs up and then forward to give your body momentum to sit up." = "初始姿态为坐在训练椅上，握着哑铃并将之紧贴大腿。躯干向后屈，直到仰卧在训练椅上，使用大腿以协助你将哑铃推举至胸部。然后，手臂朝胸部上方伸直（保持肘部微屈），掌心向前。保持你的双腿平方于地板上，背部处于中立姿态（至多允许背部稍微拱起）。肘部向两侧弯屈，以降低哑铃。持续动作直到你的肘部略低于肩部。然后，再次往上推举哑铃，让哑铃在高位互相靠拢（互不接触），并略向内侧微屈。保持你的肘部微屈，而不是锁定肘部关节。重复动作直到你完成一组锻炼。为了起坐，持着哑铃紧贴胸部，向上踢腿，接着向前倾以让你的身体有动力起坐。";

"Parallel Bar Dips" = "双槓臂屈伸";
"First, keep your head down during the course of the movement and move your body forward. Secondly, move your elbows out a bit. That is, keep your elbows out and away from your body. This will ensure that you are using more chest than triceps. Remember, really concentrate on squeezing your entire chest area at the top of the movement." = "首先，在锻炼全程，保持你的头部低着，以及身体前倾。其次，两肘稍微向外侧伸展，亦即保持你的肘部外展和远离身体。这是为了确保你以较大程度使用胸部，而不是三头肌。记得，当你达致高点时，全心专注于挤压你的整个胸部。";

"Cable Crossover Flys" = "拉力器夹胸";
"This exercise is performed using the cable pulley machine that has a pulley on two opposite sides. Set each pulley up so that it is locked in the high position (if you are not sure how to do this, ask a trainer at the gym you workout at to assist you). While standing, grab each high pulley using a small one-hand attachment for each hand. The position your body will be in will look like a giant letter. Slowly bring your arms together in a slow and controlled fashion. While doing so, visualize that you are hugging a giant tree trunk. At the peak of this movement, really flex your pec muscles together for a one-count and then return to the start position and repeat." = "采用具有两个相对面滑轮的滑轮拉力器进行此锻炼。将手柄与高位滑轮链接（若你不确定如何做，请求你健身室的锻炼教练协助你）。当站立时，每只手各握着高位滑轮的手柄。你的身体姿态看起来像大字型。缓慢平稳地让你的双手互相靠拢。在这个动作，想象你正拥抱着一棵巨硕的树。当你的动作达致顶峰时，彻底收缩你的胸肌，停留片刻后，回到初始姿态，然后重复动作。";

"Dumbbell Flys" = "仰卧飞鸟";
"To perform dumbbell flies pick, up a relatively light weight in each hand. You will need to experiment to determine how much weight is right for your dumbbell flies. Start with a lighter weight then slowly work your way up. Lie down on a weight bench and raise both dumbbells straight up over your chest with your arms straight. This is your starting position. Spread both arms outward in a wide arc until your arms are out at your sides. Your arms can be slightly bent. This is the fly part of the dumbbell flies. It is called that because you look like you are flying. Follow the same arc back up until the dumbbells return to the starting position. This is one repetition of the dumbbell fly." = "为了进行仰卧飞鸟这个锻炼，双手持着相对较轻的负重。你在执行仰卧飞鸟锻炼时，必须试验以确认合宜你的负重重量。以较轻的负重开始，然后依据自身的状态，逐渐提高重量。仰卧于举重床，然后手臂伸直，将两个哑铃往胸部上方举高。这是你的初始姿态。双臂向外伸展并呈大弧度，直到其处于远离你体侧的位置。可稍微弯屈你的手臂。这是仰卧飞鸟之飞鸟部分。它的命名如此是因为你看上去像在飞翔。以同样的弧度往上伸展你的手臂，直到哑铃回到初始位置。这是仰卧飞鸟的一次动作。";

"Dumbbell Pullovers" = "哑铃仰卧屈臂上拉";
"This is very similar to the bent arm barbell pullovers, except that you will be using a dumbbell instead of a barbell. Lie flat on your back on a flat bench. Begin by holding the dumbbell above your chest with your elbows slightly bent. Slowly lower the dumbbell back so as to stretch your arms (and the dumbbell) back behind your head as far as you can reach. Your arms and the dumbbell will actually go behind/above your head and will drop down below the bench- this will really give you a great stretch! Return the dumbbell to the start position slowly, focusing on keeping your elbows locked in the slightly bent position." = "此锻炼与杠铃屈臂上拉极其类似，只是你使用哑铃，而不是杠铃。背部着地平躺。初始姿态是持着哑铃并将其置于胸部上方，肘部微屈。手臂伸展（与哑铃一起）至尽可能远的头部后方，以缓慢地降低哑铃。实际上，你的手臂和哑铃将处于你头部的后方/上方，并垂落于训练椅的下方，这动作可让你大幅度地伸展肌肉！缓慢地使哑铃回到初始位置，专注于保持你的微屈肘部是锁定的。";

Continue lowering until your knees are at a 90-degree bend.

"Angled Leg Presses" = "腿部斜蹬机";
"Sit on the machine with your back and head against the padded support. Place feet on the foot plate about hip width apart, ensuring the heels are flat. The legs should form an angle of about 90 degrees at the knee with a little variation either way as long as the heels sit flat on the plate. The knees should be in line with the feet and neither bowed inward nor outward. Your bottom should not be raised from the seat platform. If it is, and the legs are at too sharp an angle, then you need to adjust the seat back until the correct position is enabled. You can recognize this poor position when the knees seem to be in front of your eyes and you feel cramped.
