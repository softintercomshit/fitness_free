//Chest

"Bench Presses" = "仰臥推舉";
"To properly perform a bench press exercise you need to lay flat on a bench and have your feet flat on the floor. The bar, when racked, will be slightly behind your head. It is important to use a spotter for this exercise, especially if you are using a free bar or dumbbells, to eliminate the chance of dropping the weight on yourself. Once you have lifted the weight off of the rack, the bar will be directly over the center of your chest. Keep your head on the bench at all times throughout the movement. Once you have the bar steady, slowly lower it to about chest level, if you are able to. Keep your arms pointed outward as the bar drops. Upon reaching the bottom of the movement, press the bar back up to an extended position, focusing on driving the bar upwards with your chest and arms." = "為了正當地進行仰臥推舉這個鍛煉，你必須平躺於訓練椅上，將雙腳平放於地板上。掛著的杠桿處於你頭部的略后方。在此鍛煉中，監視人的看管是至關重要的，這是為了排除負重落在你身上的可能性 ，尤其是當你使用不掛在架上的杠桿或啞鈴。當你從架子舉起負重時，該杠桿將位于你胸部的上方。在整個動作的過程，保持你的頭部固定在訓練椅上。當你確保杠桿處於穩定狀態時，如果你有能力，緩慢地將其降低至胸部水平。在放下杠桿的期間，保持你的手臂向外。當杠桿位於低位時，將杠桿再次往上推舉，直到你處於伸展姿態，專注於使用胸部和手臂將杠桿朝上推舉。";

"Incline Presses" = "上斜臥推";
"This exercise is very similar to the regular barbell bench press except that you will be using an incline free weight bench press machine and your upper chest will be the muscle group worked instead of your middle chest. Lift the barbell off of the rack and slowly lower it to about 3 inches above your clavicle (just below your Adam's apple) and then press the bar back to the start position. DO NOT TOUCH THE BAR TO YOUR UPPER CHEST (this causes unneeded stress on your shoulder joints and takes the tension away from your upper pec muscles, which are what we want to be doing the work!). Be sure that when you are lowering the bar that you do so in a slow and controlled fashion. Conversely, when you press the bar upward, you want to do so in an explosive fashion." = "此鍛煉與正規的杠鈴臥推鍛煉極其類似，除非你使用上斜臥推自由重量訓練器，那么你鍛煉的肌群是上胸部，而不是胸部中央。舉起架上的杠桿，緩慢地降低它至鎖骨以上約三英寸（喉結略下方），然后將杠桿推回初始位置。勿使杠桿觸碰你的上胸部（這為肩關節帶來不必要的應力，確保你的上胸肌不受張力影響，此避忌對我們的鍛煉是極其重要的！）。當你降低杠桿時，確保你的動作緩慢，以及受控制。反之，你能激烈地往上推舉杠桿。";

"Dumbbell Presses" = "啞鈴臥推";
"Get into position by sitting on the bench, hold the dumbbells and allow them to rest on your thighs. Whilst rolling your body back to lie down on the bench, use your thighs to help you push the dumbbells up to your chest.

Keep your feet flat on the floor and your back in neutral (no more than a slight arch).Lower the dumbbells by bending your elbows out to the sides. Keep going until your elbows are just below your shoulders. Then press the dumbbells back up, bringing them close together at the top (without touching), and angled slightly inwards. Keep a slight bend in your elbows, don't allow them to lock. Repeat until you've completed your reps. To get up, hold the dumbbells by your chest, kick your legs up and then forward to give your body momentum to sit up." = "初始姿態為坐在訓練椅上，握著啞鈴並將之緊貼大腿。軀干向后屈，直到仰臥在訓練椅上，使用大腿以協助你將啞鈴推舉至胸部。然后，手臂朝胸部上方伸直（保持肘部微屈），掌心向前。保持你的雙腿平方於地板上，背部處於中立姿態（至多允許背部稍微拱起）。肘部向兩側彎屈，以降低啞鈴。持續動作直到你的肘部略低于肩部。然后，再次往上推舉啞鈴，讓啞鈴在高位互相靠攏（互不接觸），並略向內側微屈。保持你的肘部微屈，而不是鎖定肘部關節。重復動作直到你完成一組鍛煉。為了起坐，持著啞鈴緊貼胸部，向上踢腿，接著向前傾以讓你的身體有動力起坐。";

"Parallel Bar Dips" = "雙槓臂屈伸";
"First, keep your head down during the course of the movement and move your body forward. Secondly, move your elbows out a bit. That is, keep your elbows out and away from your body. This will ensure that you are using more chest than triceps. Remember, really concentrate on squeezing your entire chest area at the top of the movement." = "首先，在鍛煉全程，保持你的頭部低著，以及身體前傾。其次，兩肘稍微向外側伸展，亦即保持你的肘部外展和遠離身體。這是為了確保你以較大程度使用胸部，而不是三頭肌。記得，當你達致高點時，全心專注於擠壓你的整個胸部。";

"Cable Crossover Flys" = "拉力器夾胸";
"This exercise is performed using the cable pulley machine that has a pulley on two opposite sides. Set each pulley up so that it is locked in the high position (if you are not sure how to do this, ask a trainer at the gym you workout at to assist you). While standing, grab each high pulley using a small one-hand attachment for each hand. The position your body will be in will look like a giant letter. Slowly bring your arms together in a slow and controlled fashion. While doing so, visualize that you are hugging a giant tree trunk. At the peak of this movement, really flex your pec muscles together for a one-count and then return to the start position and repeat." = "采用具有兩個相對面滑輪的滑輪拉力器進行此鍛煉。將手柄與高位滑輪鏈接（若你不確定如何做，請求你健身室的鍛煉教練協助你）。當站立時，每只手各握著高位滑輪的手柄。你的身體姿態看起來像大字型。緩慢平穩地讓你的雙手互相靠攏。在這個動作，想象你正擁抱著一棵巨硕的樹。當你的動作達致頂峰時，徹底收縮你的胸肌，停留片刻后，回到初始姿態，然后重復動作。";

"Dumbbell Flys" = "仰臥飛鳥";
"To perform dumbbell flies pick, up a relatively light weight in each hand. You will need to experiment to determine how much weight is right for your dumbbell flies. Start with a lighter weight then slowly work your way up. Lie down on a weight bench and raise both dumbbells straight up over your chest with your arms straight. This is your starting position. Spread both arms outward in a wide arc until your arms are out at your sides. Your arms can be slightly bent. This is the fly part of the dumbbell flies. It is called that because you look like you are flying. Follow the same arc back up until the dumbbells return to the starting position. This is one repetition of the dumbbell fly." = "為了進行仰臥飛鳥這個鍛煉，雙手持著相對較輕的負重。你在執行仰臥飛鳥鍛煉時，必須試驗以確認合宜你的負重重量。以較輕的負重開始，然后依據自身的狀態，逐漸提高重量。仰臥於舉重床，然后手臂伸直，將兩個啞鈴往胸部上方舉高。這是你的初始姿態。雙臂向外伸展並呈大弧度，直到其處於遠離你體側的位置。可稍微彎屈你的手臂。這是仰臥飛鳥之飛鳥部分。它的命名如此是因為你看上去像在飛翔。以同樣的弧度往上伸展你的手臂，直到啞鈴回到初始位置。這是仰臥飛鳥的一次動作。";

"Dumbbell Pullovers" = "啞鈴仰臥屈臂上拉";
"This is very similar to the bent arm barbell pullovers, except that you will be using a dumbbell instead of a barbell. Lie flat on your back on a flat bench. Begin by holding the dumbbell above your chest with your elbows slightly bent. Slowly lower the dumbbell back so as to stretch your arms (and the dumbbell) back behind your head as far as you can reach. Your arms and the dumbbell will actually go behind/above your head and will drop down below the bench- this will really give you a great stretch! Return the dumbbell to the start position slowly, focusing on keeping your elbows locked in the slightly bent position." = "此鍛煉與杠鈴屈臂上拉極其類似，只是你使用啞鈴，而不是杠鈴。背部著地平躺。初始姿態是持著啞鈴並將其置於胸部上方，肘部微屈。手臂伸展（與啞鈴一起）至盡可能遠的頭部后方，以緩慢地降低啞鈴。實際上，你的手臂和啞鈴將處於你頭部的后方/上方，並垂落於訓練椅的下方，這動作可讓你大幅度地伸展肌肉！緩慢地使啞鈴回到初始位置，專注於保持你的微屈肘部是鎖定的。";
