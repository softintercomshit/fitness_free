Stand with feet about hip-width apart, abs engaged as you hold medium-heavy dumbbells in front of the thighs. Squeeze the biceps and bend the arms, curling the weights up towards the shoulders. Keep the elbows stationary and only bring the weight as high as you can without moving the elbows. Slowly lower the weights, keeping a slight bend in the elbows at the bottom (e.g., don't lock the joints and try to keep tension on the muscle)
