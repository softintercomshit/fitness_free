Start in a standing position with your feet shoulder width apart and your knees relaxed. Grasp a barbell with your hands also shoulder width apart. Your grip should be underhand (palms facing upwards). Stand upright and let the bar hang in front of your thighs. Bend at your elbows to curl the bar to shoulder level. Pause momentarily at this top position. Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position.
