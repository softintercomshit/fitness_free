Start by sitting on the edge of the bench, holding the dumbbell in your right hand. Let the right arm hang straight down with the elbow resting on the inside of the knee. Lean forward so your torso is over your legs, and place the left hand on the left knee. Bending at the elbow, curl the dumbbell up to shoulder level and pause momentarily before slowly lowering the weight to the starting position. Repeat until your set is finished, then switch sides and complete with the left arm.
