Stand upright with dumbbells hanging at the sides, feet just wide enough so that the dumbbells hang comfortably. They can be heavier than you would use for an arm curl or front raise. Shrug the shoulders upward just like you would if you were saying I don't know to someone in response to a question. Don't hunch over to the front; try to stay completely upright. If you find your are hunching over or bending backward, lighten the weights up a little.
