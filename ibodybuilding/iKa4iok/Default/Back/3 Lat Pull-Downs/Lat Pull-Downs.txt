Attach a long bar to the lat pulldown machine, and adjust the thigh pads so that when you are sitting your knees are at right angles and feet flat on the ground. Grasp the bar using a wide grip and sit down maintaining the upper body in an upright position, slightly leaning back from the hips. Pull the bar in front of your face to the top of your chest and pause. Slowly release the bar back to the starting position by straightening your arms.
