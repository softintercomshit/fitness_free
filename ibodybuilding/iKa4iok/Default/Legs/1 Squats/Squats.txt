The squat involves lowering yourself to the floor without bending at the lower back. Instead, you use your legs to lower your body, keeping your spine in a neutral position. Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Press your hips back and bend your knees. Keep your weight back on your heels, not on the balls of your feet. Your knees should stay behind your toes. Continue lowering until your knees are at a 90-degree bend. Pause for a count and then push through your heels, extending your knees and hips.
