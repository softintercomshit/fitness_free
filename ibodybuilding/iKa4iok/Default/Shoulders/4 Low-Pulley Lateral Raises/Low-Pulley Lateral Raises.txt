Stand close to the cable machine and side-on to it, position your arm slightly in front of your thighs and take hold of the handle. Inhale and, keeping a slight bend in the elbow, raise your arm out to the side of the body until your upper arm is level with your shoulder. Keep your palm facing down. Slowly, and with the movement under control, lower your arm back down to the start position.
