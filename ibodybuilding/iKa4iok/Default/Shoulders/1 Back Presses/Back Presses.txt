Start by sitting on the bench (with back support). Grasp the barbell using an overhand grip. Hold the dumbbells above the shoulders slightly in front of you, pointing the elbows towards the floor. Push the barbell up and overhead so that the arms are fully extended. After a pause lower the weights to the starting position.
