Stand with your feet slightly spread. Keep your back straight. Take an overhand grip on the bar with your hands palm-width apart or a little more: - Inhale and pull the barbell straight upward until it contacts your chin. - Lift your elbows as high as possible at the top point of the movement. - Exhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting point.
