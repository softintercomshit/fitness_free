This is very similar to the bent arm barbell pullovers, except that you will be using a dumbbell instead of a barbell. Lie flat on your back on a flat bench. Begin by holding the dumbbell above your chest with your elbows slightly bent. Slowly lower the dumbbell back so as to stretch your arms (and the dumbbell) back behind your head as far as you can reach. Your arms and the dumbbell will actually go behind/above your head and will drop down below the bench- this will really give you a great stretch! Return the dumbbell to the start position slowly, focusing on keeping your elbows locked in the slightly bent position.
