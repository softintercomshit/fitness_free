Lie flat on the bench with feet on the floor for stability, your arms extended upward, and your hands facing in toward each other holding the dumbbells: - Inhale and lower the dumbbells to chest level, bending your elbows and rotating your forearms to bring your hand in pronation. - Press the dumbbells back up and do an isometric contraction to isolate the stress on the pectorals; exhale as you complete the movement.
