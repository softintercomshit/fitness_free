To properly perform a bench press exercise you need to lay flat on a bench and have your feet flat on the floor. The bar, when racked, will be slightly behind your head. It is important to use a spotter for this exercise, especially if you are using a free bar or dumbbells, to eliminate the chance of dropping the weight on yourself. Once you have lifted the weight off of the rack, the bar will be directly over the center of your chest. Keep your head on the bench at all times throughout the movement. Once you have the bar steady, slowly lower it to about chest level, if you are able to. Keep your arms pointed outward as the bar drops. Upon reaching the bottom of the movement, press the bar back up to an extended position, focusing on driving the bar upwards with your chest and arms.
