Lie prone with your arms straight, your palms flat on the floor, and your hands shoulder-width apart (or wider). Hold your feet together or very slightly spread: - Inhale and bend your elbows to bring your torso near the floor, avoiding extreme hyperextension of your spine. - Push yourself back to arms, extended position, exhaling as you complete the movement.
