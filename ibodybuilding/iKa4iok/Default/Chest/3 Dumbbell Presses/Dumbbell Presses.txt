Get into position by sitting on the bench, hold the dumbbells and allow them to rest on your thighs. Whilst rolling your body back to lie down on the bench, use your thighs to help you push the dumbbells up to your chest. Then straighten your arms up over your chest (keeping a slight bend in elbows), palms facing forward. Keep your feet flat on the floor and your back in neutral (no more than a slight arch).Lower the dumbbells by bending your elbows out to the sides. Keep going until your elbows are just below your shoulders. Then press the dumbbells back up, bringing them close together at the top (without touching), and angled slightly inwards. Keep a slight bend in your elbows, don't allow them to lock. Repeat until you've completed your reps. To get up, hold the dumbbells by your chest, kick your legs up and then forward to give your body momentum to sit up.
