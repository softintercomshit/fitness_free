Place your hands on the edge of a flat bench and rest your feet on another bench. Assume a torso-leg angle of about 90 degrees: - Inhale and bend your arms. - Straighten your arms to return to the starting point, exhaling as you complete the movement. This exercise works the triceps, pectorals, and anterior deltoids.
