Using a high-cable pulley, grasp a short straight bar with an overhand grip. Your hands should be about 10 inches apart. Position your forearms so they are parallel to the floor. Keep your feet shoulder width apart and bend your knees slightly. Keep your elbows locked in close to your body and your wrists straight. Keep your WHOLE body steady, push the bar down as far as possible towards your legs, locking your arms and feeling the triceps full contract. Keep the upper arms close to the body. Return to the starting position using the same motion. Never move your elbows or torso! Stay standing straight up.
