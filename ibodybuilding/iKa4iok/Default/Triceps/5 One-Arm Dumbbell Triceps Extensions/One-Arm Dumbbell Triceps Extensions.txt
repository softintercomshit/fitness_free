Hold your arm in full extension up above your body. Make sure your elbow is facing away from your body. With your non-weight bearing hand, grab and support your other arm just below the elbow. Next, lower the weight down, bending at your elbow. Once the forearm is parallel to the floor you may bring the arm back to full extension.
